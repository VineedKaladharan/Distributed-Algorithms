1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:05,520
Our course is about
distributed algorithms,

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,790
but this week we won't talk

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,320
about distributed things or
algorithmic things.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,670
We will study graph theory,

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,790
because we will later need
plenty of it in this course.

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:23,160
In this lecture,
I'll introduce some basic

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,540
graph-theoretic concepts
with the help of an example.

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,930
In the course material you'll
find the formal definitions

9
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:35,770
of everything we use here,
but I hope you can follow

10
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,440
this presentation as long as
you are familiar with

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,260
the basic concepts
like graphs, nodes, and edges.

12
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,810
I'd like to emphasize that here

13
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,829
all graphs are simple,
undirected graphs.

14
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:54,870
There is a finite,
nonempty set of nodes,

15
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:02,500
and a set of edges, and each
edge is a set of 2 nodes.

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:09,190
To illustrate some key ideas,
I'll prove the following theorem:

17
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:14,700
In any d-regular graph
(where d is at least 1),

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,580
a minimum vertex cover is always

19
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:24,440
a d-approximation of
a minimum dominating set.

20
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,490
Let me decompose this and
explain all words here,

21
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,250
so that we understand
what we claim here.

22
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:38,380
The degree of a node
is the number of neighbors.

23
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:44,030
And a graph is d-regular if
all nodes have degree d.

24
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:47,090
So we are focusing here
on graphs in which

25
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,549
all nodes have the same
number of neighbors.

26
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:56,090
Here are some examples
of 1-regular graphs,

27
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,090
2-regular graphs,
and 3-regular graphs.

28
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,630
For example, this graph here is
3-regular: if you look at

29
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:12,019
any node, you'll see that
it has got exactly 3 neighbors.

30
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:16,389
Good, so now we
understand this part.

31
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:21,189
Then what about vertex covers?

32
00:02:21,189 --> 00:02:25,760
Let's assume C is
a subset of nodes.

33
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,200
We say that C is a vertex cover

34
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:37,230
if, for each edge, we have got
at least 1 endpoint in set C.

35
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:42,879
For example, here this set of
nodes is a vertex cover.

36
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,749
If you take any edge,

37
00:02:44,749 --> 00:02:51,079
you will see that at least one
endpoint is in set C.

38
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:56,169
You can have both endpoints in C.
But you must have at least 1.

39
00:02:56,169 --> 00:03:00,879
For example, this set of nodes
is not a vertex cover, as we've

40
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,900
got this edge here that doesn't
have any endpoint selected.

41
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,159
So you can think about
vertex covers so that

42
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,150
each node covers all
of its incident edges.

43
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:21,480
And a set of nodes is a vertex
cover if it covers all edges.

44
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,980
And we say that C is
a minimum vertex cover

45
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,079
if it is a vertex cover

46
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:32,109
that has the smallest
possible number of nodes.

47
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:36,930
So for example this one here
is a minimum vertex cover.

48
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,760
It is a vertex cover
with 2 nodes,

49
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,949
and for this graph there is no
vertex cover with fewer nodes.

50
00:03:45,949 --> 00:03:49,099
This one is not
a minimum vertex cover,

51
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:50,599
because it has got 3 nodes,

52
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,040
while 2 nodes are enough
to cover the graph.

53
00:03:54,040 --> 00:04:00,409
Good, so now we know
what this part means.

54
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:04,589
Then let's look at this part,
dominating sets.

55
00:04:04,589 --> 00:04:09,329
Let's assume that D
is a subset of nodes.

56
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:13,839
We say that D is
a dominating set

57
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:20,570
if each node is in D or has got
at least one neighbors in D.

58
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:25,790
For example, here this set of
nodes is a dominating set.

59
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:30,900
If you take any node, either
it is already selected,

60
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,690
or at least 1 of its neighbors
is selected.

61
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:40,150
For example, this set of nodes
is not a dominating set,

62
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,370
as we've got this node here

63
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:47,560
that is not selected, and none
of its neighbors are selected.

64
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,700
The intuition here is that

65
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,100
a node can dominate
all of its neighbors.

66
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,400
And a set of nodes is

67
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,600
a dominating set if
all nodes are dominated.

68
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,130
And now D is
a minimum dominating set

69
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,680
if it is a dominating set

70
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,840
that has the smallest possible
number of nodes.

71
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,010
So for example this one here is
a minimum dominating set.

72
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,460
It is a dominating set
with 2 nodes,

73
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:21,530
and for this graph there is no
dominating set with fewer nodes.

74
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:26,330
And this one is not
a minimum dominating set,

75
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,180
because it has got 3 nodes,

76
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:32,050
while 2 nodes are enough
to dominate the graph.

77
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:39,150
Good, we are making progress, we
know also what this part means.

78
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,760
Finally, we need to understand
approximations.

79
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,530
When we say that set D is

80
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:52,740
a k-approximation of
a minimum dominating set,

81
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,140
we mean the following.

82
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:00,030
First, D is a dominating set.

83
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:04,020
Second, the size of D is

84
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:09,960
at most k times the size of
the minimum dominating set.

85
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,590
That's it.

86
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,600
That's the full
definition, nothing more.

87
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,640
Please note that

88
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,990
approximations have to be
feasible dominating sets.

89
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,100
It isn't roughly
a dominating set.

90
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,710
It has to be exactly
a dominating set.

91
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,460
The only sloppiness is
in the size.

92
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:34,430
It doesn't need to be
a minimum-size dominating set,

93
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,470
it can be larger by some factor.

94
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,060
For example, this is an example

95
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:47,530
of a 2-approximation of
a minimum dominating set.

96
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:53,950
In this graph the minimum
dominating set is 3 nodes.

97
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:59,230
And here we have
a dominating set with 6 nodes.

98
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,950
Six is at most 2 times 3.

99
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,170
So this is a 2-approximation.

100
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,980
So now we understand all terms.

101
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:13,990
Let's rephrase the claim
so that it is easier to follow.

102
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,330
We can take any
positive integer d.

103
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:23,550
And we can take any graph G
that is d-regular.

104
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,780
And we can take any
minimum vertex cover X.

105
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,810
And the claim is that X is also

106
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:37,330
a d-approximation of
a minimum dominating set.

107
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:43,690
And to make it more clear,
let's expand it a bit.

108
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,940
Consider any minimum
vertex cover X and

109
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,400
any minimum dominating set Y.

110
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,580
Then we claim that X is
also a dominating set,

111
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:02,980
and its size is not more than
d times the size of Y.

112
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,670
Does this claim make any sense?

113
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:08,350
Let's quickly go through
some examples.

114
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:11,720
Here d = 1.

115
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,970
We have a 1-regular graph.

116
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,980
Here is a minimum vertex cover X
with 1 node,

117
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:22,160
and a minimum dominating set Y
with 1 node.

118
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,880
It's easy to check that X is
also a dominating set,

119
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:32,610
and indeed its size is
1 times the size of Y.

120
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,139
Here d = 2.

121
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,569
We have a 2-regular graph.

122
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:39,329
Here is a minimum vertex cover X
with 2 nodes,

123
00:08:39,329 --> 00:08:42,909
and a minimum dominating set Y
with 1 node.

124
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:47,319
We can check that X is
also a dominating set,

125
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:53,209
and its size is 2 times the size
of Y, just like it should be.

126
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:55,449
And another example for d = 2.

127
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:58,130
Another 2-regular graph.

128
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,540
A minimum vertex cover X
with 3 nodes,

129
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:07,579
and a minimum dominating set Y
with 2 nodes.

130
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:11,170
Again, X is a also
a dominating set,

131
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:16,100
and its size is at most
2 times the size of Y.

132
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,709
Please note that here we are
doing a bit better,

133
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:25,500
the size of X is only 1.5 times
the size of Y, but that's fine.

134
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,930
And here d is 3.

135
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,079
And here is an example of
a graph where

136
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:32,529
a minimum vertex cover
has 3 nodes

137
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:36,470
and a minimum dominating set
has got 1 node.

138
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:41,290
Again, the size of X is
at most 3 times the size of Y,

139
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,860
and X is also a dominating set.

140
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,449
And a yet another example here.

141
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:51,970
A minimum vertex cover
with 4 nodes.

142
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,300
A minimum dominating set
with 2 nodes.

143
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,709
Factor-2 difference,
which is at most 3.

144
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:05,300
Good, so the claim
at least seems to make sense

145
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,759
in these examples,
and we know also that

146
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,680
the claim is basically
the strongest possible.

147
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,569
In the previous examples we saw

148
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:21,889
that sometimes the ratio is
exactly d, sometimes less.

149
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:25,769
Now let's prove this claim!

150
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:29,180
We need to prove 2 things.

151
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,059
First, we need to prove that

152
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:36,560
a minimum vertex cover
is also a dominating set.

153
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,279
Second, we need to prove that
a minimum vertex cover is not

154
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,550
that much larger than
the smallest dominating set.

155
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,070
Let's start with the first part.

156
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:53,829
Let X be any vertex cover.

157
00:10:53,829 --> 00:10:54,829
We don't need to use

158
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:57,639
the property that it is
a minimum vertex cover here,

159
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:00,490
so we can just look at
any vertex cover.

160
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:06,000
We need to show that
X dominates all nodes, that is,

161
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,079
all nodes not in X have at
least one neighbor in X.

162
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,730
To do this, consider any node u.

163
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,579
The graph is d-regular and
d is at least 1,

164
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:25,990
so node u has got at least one
neighbor, let's call it v.

165
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,690
So in the graph there is
an edge {u,v}.

166
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:32,129
And X is a vertex cover,

167
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:36,740
so it contains at least one
of the endpoints of this edge.

168
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:39,290
So u is in X, or

169
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:44,459
if this is not the case,
its neighbor v is in X.

170
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:49,910
So we are done:
X is a dominating set.

171
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,040
Now comes the more
interesting part.

172
00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:00,379
We need to bound the size of X
in comparison with the size of Y.

173
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:03,939
We don't need to use
the property that Y is

174
00:12:03,939 --> 00:12:08,839
a minimum dominating set here,
it is enough to show that X

175
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,850
is at most d times as large as
any dominating set,

176
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,790
and then it of course also holds

177
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:22,769
for the specific case of
a minimum dominating set.

178
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:27,060
Let's use n to denote the total
number of nodes in the graph.

179
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:31,620
We will first compare
the size of Y with n,

180
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,230
and then compare
the size of X with n,

181
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,190
and this will give what we want.

182
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:43,010
Let's start by analyzing set Y,

183
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:48,519
which is assumed to be
some dominating set.

184
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:52,990
Let's put some tokens on
the nodes as follows.

185
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:59,699
Each node in Y puts
one token on itself and

186
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:05,319
one token on each of
its neighbors.

187
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:13,069
Because Y is a dominating set,
each node got at least 1 token.

188
00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:17,000
And because all nodes in Y
have exactly d neighbors,

189
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,350
we used d+1 tokens
per node in Y.

190
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,629
So in total the number of
tokens we used

191
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:31,029
was d+1 times the size of Y.

192
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:35,260
And because each node
got at least 1 token,

193
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,869
we must have used
at least n tokens.

194
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:44,160
So n is at most d+1 times
size of Y.

195
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:53,309
Good, let's keep this inequality
in mind, we'll use it soon.

196
00:13:53,309 --> 00:13:55,959
Let's next analyze set X,

197
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,769
which is assumed to be
a minimum vertex cover.

198
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:05,660
We'll again put some tokens
but with a twist.

199
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,079
Let's define set A that

200
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:15,540
consists of those nodes that
are not in the vertex cover.

201
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:20,319
Now each node in A puts
one token on itself

202
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:23,759
and one on each neighbor.

203
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:30,339
So the total number of tokens
is d+1 times the size of A.

204
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:35,259
And I'm claiming that each node
got at least one token,

205
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:39,410
so we had to use
at least n tokens.

206
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,709
Why is this the case?

207
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:44,540
Well, let's image that

208
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:50,410
there was a node v
that didn't get any tokens.

209
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,250
So v itself has to be
in the vertex cover,

210
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,990
otherwise it would give
a token to itself.

211
00:14:55,990 --> 00:15:01,069
And all neighbors of v have to
be also in the vertex cover,

212
00:15:01,069 --> 00:15:04,410
otherwise they would
give us tokens.

213
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,519
But what would this mean?

214
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,309
All of these edges incident to v

215
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:14,339
have both endpoints
in the vertex cover X.

216
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:19,790
If X is a vertex cover,
we could remove v from X,

217
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:23,850
and it would still be
a vertex cover.

218
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:25,189
So we could construct

219
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:31,209
another vertex cover
that is smaller than X.

220
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:35,089
But we assumed X is
a minimum vertex cover,

221
00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:37,970
so this cannot happen.

222
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,769
So it has to be the case that
all nodes got at least 1 token,

223
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:49,079
and the number of tokens
is therefore at least n.

224
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:55,069
So we have that the size of A
is at least n over d+1.

225
00:15:55,069 --> 00:16:01,240
And now we know enough about
the size of X.

226
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,139
It's the complement of A, so its
size is n minus the size of A.

227
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:10,029
And using this gives this,

228
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:18,290
so the size of X is at most
d over d+1 times n.

229
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:23,089
Now let's recall what
I told you to remember.

230
00:16:23,089 --> 00:16:29,759
We already proved that n is
at most d+1 times the size of Y.

231
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,839
So the size of X is
at most d times the size of Y,

232
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:41,189
which is exactly what
we were supposed to prove!

233
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:43,389
So a theorem proved.

234
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:46,670
Why did we do this?

235
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,970
Not because this is an important
result in graph theory,

236
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,249
it certainly isn't.

237
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:57,360
But because this proof
demonstrates both key concepts

238
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,100
and some useful proof techniques
that we will use in this course.

239
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,940
By the way, it's good to note
that we didn't really ever need

240
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:13,260
the property that
X is a minimum vertex cover.

241
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,079
We only need to assume that

242
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:20,480
if you remove any node from X,
it is no longer a vertex cover.

243
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,940
So it was enough to assume that
X is a minimal vertex cover,

244
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:30,980
that is, you can't remove
any nodes from it.

245
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,340
On the other hand,
if you only assumed

246
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:39,380
that X is a vertex cover,
this claim is no longer true.

247
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,520
Can you see why?

248
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,090
What's the simplest
counterexample?
